    "\n",
    "We have two datasets to work with:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset 1 (dataset1.csv)**:\n",
    "   - This one has a bunch of columns about students, like how many hours they studied, their attendance, and stuff like that.\n",
    "   - It also includes some categories, like whether they had access to resources or if they were involved in extracurricular activities.\n",
    "   - Overall, it gives a good picture of their backgrounds and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dataset 2 (dataset2.csv)**:\n",
    "   - This dataset focuses on the actual scores: Math, Reading, Writing, and a Placement Score.\n",
    "   - It’s more about the outcomes of their studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Similarities and Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "**Similarities**:\n",
    "- Both datasets deal with students and their academic stuff.\n",
    "- They relate to how students perform in school, which is super relevant for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences**:\n",
    "- Dataset 1 has a lot more details about students' experiences and environments.\n",
    "- Dataset 2 is mainly about their scores, so it’s smaller and focused just on performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyzing the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For the analysis, we can aim to predict how well students will do (like their scores) based on the info in Dataset 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Which Algorithms to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a couple of machine learning algorithms that could work well:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Regression**:\n",
    "   - This is good for predicting scores since it looks at relationships between things (like how study hours might affect scores).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Random Forest Regression**:\n",
    "   - This one’s a bit more complex and can handle a mix of numbers and categories. It's great if we think there might be non-linear relationships between the factors."
